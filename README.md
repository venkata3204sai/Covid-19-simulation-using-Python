# Covid-19 Simulation (Python)

Simulates the spread of COVID-19 using a per-country sampled population and a simple Markov-chain per-person model.  
This assignment-style project creates a per-person daily time-series, a per-country daily summary, and a visualization of infection waves. It also includes a small Streamlit app to run and visualize the results.

## Snapshot
- Status: working (no automated CI or packaging yet).
- Language: Python
- Key files: `assignment2.py`, `app.py` (Streamlit UI), `helper.py`, `sim_parameters.py`, `a2-countries.csv`, `test.py`.
- Outputs: `a2-covid-simulated-timeseries.csv`, `a2-covid-summary-timeseries.csv`, `a2-covid-simulation.png`.

## What it does
- Builds sampled populations for selected countries (sample ratio, e.g. `1e6`).
- Runs a per-person, daily Markov chain using age-group specific transition probabilities (from `sim_parameters.py`) between states: `H` (healthy), `I` (infected, no symptoms), `S` (symptomatic), `M` (immune), `D` (deceased).
- Saves:
  - `a2-covid-simulated-timeseries.csv` — long table of person/day/state.
  - `a2-covid-summary-timeseries.csv` — aggregated counts per country/day for states D, H, I, M, S.
  - `a2-covid-simulation.png` — chart created by `helper.py::create_plot()`.

## Quick setup (local)
1. Create venv and install:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or: pip install pandas matplotlib streamlit
```
2. Run the simulation (default inputs are read from test.py):
```bash
# Run assignment script directly (example arguments)
python assignment2.py
# or if the file exposes run() and test.py calls it, run the test driver:
python test.py
```
3. Run the Streamlit app (interactive):
```bash
streamlit run app.py
# then open http://localhost:8501
```

## Files and roles

- assignment2.py — main simulator (implements run(countries_csv_name, countries, start_date, end_date, sample_ratio)).
- sim_parameters.py — transition probabilities and holding times per age group.
- helper.py — plotting helper (provides create_plot() used to produce PNG).
- app.py — Streamlit UI that calls assignment2.run(...).
- test.py — example driver and test harness.
- a2-countries.csv — country demographics input.
- ass2.ipynb — notebook used for experimentation.

Outputs (generated by running):
- a2-covid-simulated-timeseries.csv
- a2-covid-summary-timeseries.csv
- a2-covid-simulation.png

Example usage

Run the sim for ["Afghanistan", "Sweden", "Japan"] from 2021-04-01 to 2022-04-30 with sample ratio 1e6. Output CSV + PNG will be written to the project root.
